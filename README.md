# Simple Happy Birthday Website

Simple website to wish happy birthday to your friends/family/yourself. 

## How it works

1. To specify the name of the person, enter a query parameter as such: ?name=nameOfThePerson (?name=John) --> https://nightandstars.github.io/surprise/?name=John
   1. You can also change it directly in the code
2. Make sure to press Enter after modifying the URL
3. Make sure to allow sounds to be played and turn the volume up
4. Click on the nice little "Click Me" button
5. Enjoy!
6. At the end you will get a "replay animation" at the bottom of the page

## What I used

[Canvas-Confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) - mix of the emoji and snow examples to create the balloon animation
